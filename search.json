In order to do this we will call llm_sentiment():\nreviews |&gt;\n  llm_sentiment(review)\n#&gt; # A tibble: 3 × 2\n#&gt;   review                                                              .sentiment\n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;                                                               &lt;chr&gt;     \n#&gt; 1 This has been the best TV I've ever used.

It is too slow and the keyboard is to… negative  \n#&gt; 2 Not sure how to feel about my new washing machine. Great color, bu… negative\n\n\n\nThere may be a need to reduce the number of words in a given text. Usually, to make it easier to capture its intent. To do this, use llm_summarize(). This function has an argument to control the maximum number of words to output (max_words):\nreviews |&gt;\n  llm_summarize(review, max_words = 5)\n#&gt; # A tibble: 3 × 2\n#&gt;   review                                        .summary                       \n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;                                         &lt;chr&gt;                          \n#&gt; 1 This has been the best TV I've ever used. Gr… very good tv experience overall\n#&gt; 2 I regret buying this laptop. It is too slow … slow and noisy laptop purchase \n#&gt; 3 Not sure how to feel about my new washing ma… mixed feelings about new washer\nTo control the name of the prediction field, you can change pred_name argument. This works with the other llm_ functions as well.\nreviews |&gt;\n  llm_summarize(review, max_words = 5, pred_name = \"review_summary\")\n#&gt; # A tibble: 3 × 2\n#&gt;   review                                        review_summary                 \n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;                                         &lt;chr&gt;                          \n#&gt; 1 This has been the best TV I've ever used. Gr… very good tv experience overall\n#&gt; 2 I regret buying this laptop. It is too slow … slow and noisy laptop purchase \n#&gt; 3 Not sure how to feel about my new washing ma… mixed feelings about new washer\n\n\n\nUse the LLM to categorize the text into one of the options you provide:\nreviews |&gt;\n  llm_classify(review, c(\"appliance\", \"computer\"))\n#&gt; # A tibble: 3 × 2\n#&gt;   review                                        .classify\n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;                                         &lt;chr&gt;    \n#&gt; 1 This has been the best TV I've ever used. Gr… appliance\n#&gt; 2 I regret buying this laptop. It is too slow … computer \n#&gt; 3 Not sure how to feel about my new washing ma… appliance\n\n\n\nOne of the most interesting operations. Using natural language, we can tell the LLM to return a specific part of the text. In the following example, we request that the LLM return the product being referred to. We do this by simply saying “product”. The LLM understands what we mean by that word, and looks for that in the text.\nreviews |&gt;\n  llm_extract(review, \"product\")\n#&gt; # A tibble: 3 × 2\n#&gt;   review                                        .extract       \n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;                                         &lt;chr&gt;          \n#&gt; 1 This has been the best TV I've ever used.

It is too slow … laptop         \n#&gt; 3 Not sure how to feel about my new washing ma… washing machine\n\n\n\nAs the title implies, this function will translate the text into a specified language. What is really nice, it is that you don’t need to specify the language of the source text. Only the target language needs to be defined. The translation accuracy will depend on the LLM\nreviews |&gt;\n  llm_translate(review, \"spanish\")\n#&gt; # A tibble: 3 × 2\n#&gt;   review                                        .translation                    \n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;                                         &lt;chr&gt;                           \n#&gt; 1 This has been the best TV I've ever used.

It is too slow … Lamento haber comprado esta lap…\n#&gt; 3 Not sure how to feel about my new washing ma… No estoy seguro de cómo sentirm…\n\n\n\nIt is possible to pass your own prompt to the LLM, and have mall run it against each text entry. Use llm_custom() to access this functionality:\nmy_prompt &lt;- paste(\n  \"Answer a question.\",\n  \"Return only the answer, no explanation\",\n  \"Acceptable answers are 'yes', 'no'\",\n  \"Answer this about the following text, is this a happy customer?:\"\n)\n\nreviews |&gt;\n  llm_custom(review, my_prompt)\n#&gt; # A tibble: 3 × 2\n#&gt;   review                                                                   .pred\n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;                                                                    &lt;chr&gt;\n#&gt; 1 This has been the best TV I've ever used. Great screen, and sound.       Yes  \n#&gt; 2 I regret buying this laptop. It is too slow and the keyboard is too noi… No   \n#&gt; 3 Not sure how to feel about my new washing machine. Great color, but har… No\n\n\n\n\nInvoking an llm_ function will automatically initialize a model selection if you don’t have one selected yet. If there is only one option, it will pre-select it for you. If there are more than one available models, then mall will present you as menu selection so you can select which model you wish to use.\nCalling llm_use() directly will let you specify the model and backend to use. You can also setup additional arguments that will be passed down to the function that actually runs the prediction. In the case of Ollama, that function is generate().\nllm_use(\"ollama\", \"llama3.1\", seed = 100, temperature = 0.2)\n\n\n\nThe main consideration is cost. Either, time cost, or money cost.\nIf using this method with an LLM locally available, the cost will be a long running time. Unless using a very specialized LLM, a given LLM is a general model. It was fitted using a vast amount of data. So determining a response for each row, takes longer than if using a manually created NLP model. The default model used in Ollama is Llama 3.1, which was fitted using 8B parameters.\nIf using an external LLM service, the consideration will need to be for the billing costs of using such service. Keep in mind that you will be sending a lot of data to be evaluated.\nAnother consideration is the novelty of this approach. Early tests are providing encouraging results. But you, as an user, will still need to keep in mind that the predictions will not be infallible, so always check the output. At this time, I think the best use for this method, is for a quick analysis.\n\n\n\nWe will briefly cover this methods performance from two perspectives:\n\nHow long the analysis takes to run locally\nHow well it predicts\n\nTo do so, we will use the data_bookReviews data set, provided by the classmap package. For this exercise, only the first 100, of the total 1,000, are going to be part of this analysis.\nlibrary(classmap)\n\ndata(data_bookReviews)\n\nbook_reviews &lt;- data_bookReviews |&gt;\n  head(100) |&gt;\n  as_tibble()\n\nglimpse(book_reviews)\n#&gt; Rows: 100\n#&gt; Columns: 2\n#&gt; $ review    &lt;chr&gt; \"i got this as both a book and an audio file. i had waited t…\n#&gt; $ sentiment &lt;fct&gt; 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, …\nAs per the docs, sentiment is a factor indicating the sentiment of the review: negative (1) or positive (2)\nlength(strsplit(paste(book_reviews, collapse = \" \"), \" \")[[1]])\n#&gt; [1] 20571\nJust to get an idea of how much data we’re processing, I’m using a very, very simple word count. So we’re analyzing a bit over 20 thousand words.\nreviews_llm &lt;- book_reviews |&gt;\n  llm_sentiment(\n    col = review,\n    options = c(\"positive\", \"negative\"),\n    pred_name = \"predicted\"\n  )\n#&gt; ! There were 1 predictions with invalid output, they were coerced to NA\nAs far as time, on my Apple M3 machine, it took about 3 minutes to process, 100 rows, containing 20 thousand words. Setting temp to 0.2 in llm_use(), made the model run a bit faster.\nThe package uses purrr to send each prompt individually to the LLM. But, I did try a few different ways to speed up the process, unsuccessfully:\n\nUsed furrr to send multiple requests at a time. This did not work because either the LLM or Ollama processed all my requests serially. So there was no improvement.\nI also tried sending more than one row’s text at a time. This cause instability in the number of results. For example sending 5 at a time, sometimes returned 7 or 8. Even sending 2 was not stable.\n\nThis is what the new table looks like:\nreviews_llm\n#&gt; # A tibble: 100 × 3\n#&gt;    review                                        sentiment predicted\n#&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;                                         &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;    \n#&gt;  1 \"i got this as both a book and an audio file… 1         negative \n#&gt;  2 \"this book places too much emphasis on spend… 1         negative \n#&gt;  3 \"remember the hollywood blacklist? the holly… 2         negative \n#&gt;  4 \"while i appreciate what tipler was attempti… 1         negative \n#&gt;  5 \"the others in the series were great, and i … 1         negative \n#&gt;  6 \"a few good things, but she's lost her edge … 1         negative \n#&gt;  7 \"words cannot describe how ripped off and di… 1         negative \n#&gt;  8 \"1. the persective of most writers is shaped… 1         negative \n#&gt;  9 \"i have been a huge fan of michael crichton … 1         negative \n#&gt; 10 \"i saw dr. polk on c-span a month or two ago… 2         positive \n#&gt; # ℹ 90 more rows\nI used yardstick to see how well the model performed. Of course, the accuracy will not be of the “truth”, but rather the package’s results recorded in sentiment.\nlibrary(forcats)\n\nreviews_llm |&gt;\n  mutate(fct_pred = as.factor(ifelse(predicted == \"positive\", 2, 1))) |&gt;\n  yardstick::accuracy(sentiment, fct_pred)\n#&gt; # A tibble: 1 × 3\n#&gt;   .metric  .estimator .estimate\n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n#&gt; 1 accuracy binary         0.939\n\n\n\nmall includes functions that expect a vector, instead of a table, to run the predictions. This should make it easier to test things, such as custom prompts or results of specific text. Each llm_ function has a corresponding llm_vec_ function:\nllm_vec_sentiment(\"I am happy\")\n#&gt; [1] \"positive\"\nllm_vec_translate(\"Este es el mejor dia!\", \"english\")\n#&gt; [1] \"This is the best day!\""

Great color, bu… negative\nAs mentioned before, by being pipe friendly, the results from the LLM prediction can be used in further transformations:\nreviews |&gt;\n  llm_sentiment(review, options = c(\"positive\", \"negative\")) |&gt;\n  filter(.sentiment == \"negative\")\n#&gt; # A tibble: 2 × 2\n#&gt;   review                                                              .sentiment\n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;                                                               &lt;chr&gt;     \n#&gt; 1 I regret buying this laptop. It is too slow and the keyboard is to… negative  \n#&gt; 2 Not sure how to feel about my new washing machine. Great color, bu… negative\n\n\n\nThere may be a need to reduce the number of words in a given text. Usually, to make it easier to capture its intent. To do this, use llm_summarize(). This function has an argument to control the maximum number of words to output (max_words):\nreviews |&gt;\n  llm_summarize(review, max_words = 5)\n#&gt; # A tibble: 3 × 2\n#&gt;   review                                        .summary                       \n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;                                         &lt;chr&gt;                          \n#&gt; 1 This has been the best TV I've ever used. Gr… very good tv experience overall\n#&gt; 2 I regret buying this laptop. It is too slow … slow and noisy laptop purchase \n#&gt; 3 Not sure how to feel about my new washing ma… mixed feelings about new washer\nTo control the name of the prediction field, you can change pred_name argument. This works with the other llm_ functions as well.\nreviews |&gt;\n  llm_summarize(review, max_words = 5, pred_name = \"review_summary\")\n#&gt; # A tibble: 3 × 2\n#&gt;   review                                        review_summary                 \n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;                                         &lt;chr&gt;                          \n#&gt; 1 This has been the best TV I've ever used. Gr… very good tv experience overall\n#&gt; 2 I regret buying this laptop. It is too slow … slow and noisy laptop purchase \n#&gt; 3 Not sure how to feel about my new washing ma… mixed feelings about new washer\n\n\n\nUse the LLM to categorize the text into one of the options you provide:\nreviews |&gt;\n  llm_classify(review, c(\"appliance\", \"computer\"))\n#&gt; # A tibble: 3 × 2\n#&gt;   review                                        .classify\n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;                                         &lt;chr&gt;    \n#&gt; 1 This has been the best TV I've ever used. Gr… appliance\n#&gt; 2 I regret buying this laptop. It is too slow … computer \n#&gt; 3 Not sure how to feel about my new washing ma… appliance\n\n\n\nOne of the most interesting operations. Using natural language, we can tell the LLM to return a specific part of the text. In the following example, we request that the LLM return the product being referred to. We do this by simply saying “product”. The LLM understands what we mean by that word, and looks for that in the text.\nreviews |&gt;\n  llm_extract(review, \"product\")\n#&gt; # A tibble: 3 × 2\n#&gt;   review                                        .extract       \n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;                                         &lt;chr&gt;          \n#&gt; 1 This has been the best TV I've ever used. Gr… tv             \n#&gt; 2 I regret buying this laptop. It is too slow … laptop         \n#&gt; 3 Not sure how to feel about my new washing ma… washing machine\n\n\n\nAs the title implies, this function will translate the text into a specified language. What is really nice, it is that you don’t need to specify the language of the source text. Only the target language needs to be defined. The translation accuracy will depend on the LLM\nreviews |&gt;\n  llm_translate(review, \"spanish\")\n#&gt; # A tibble: 3 × 2\n#&gt;   review                                        .translation                    \n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;                                         &lt;chr&gt;                           \n#&gt; 1 This has been the best TV I've ever used.

Use llm_custom() to access this functionality:\nmy_prompt &lt;- paste(\n  \"Answer a question.\",\n  \"Return only the answer, no explanation\",\n  \"Acceptable answers are 'yes', 'no'\",\n  \"Answer this about the following text, is this a happy customer?:\"\n)\n\nreviews |&gt;\n  llm_custom(review, my_prompt)\n#&gt; # A tibble: 3 × 2\n#&gt;   review                                                                   .pred\n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;                                                                    &lt;chr&gt;\n#&gt; 1 This has been the best TV I've ever used.

    "text": "The main consideration is cost. Either, time cost, or money cost.\nIf using this method with an LLM locally available, the cost will be a long running time. Unless using a very specialized LLM, a given LLM is a general model. It was fitted using a vast amount of data. So determining a response for each row, takes longer than if using a manually created NLP model. The default model used in Ollama is Llama 3.1, which was fitted using 8B parameters.\nIf using an external LLM service, the consideration will need to be for the billing costs of using such service. Keep in mind that you will be sending a lot of data to be evaluated.\nAnother consideration is the novelty of this approach. Early tests are providing encouraging results. But you, as an user, will still need to keep in mind that the predictions will not be infallible, so always check the output. At this time, I think the best use for this method, is for a quick analysis."

But, I did try a few different ways to speed up the process, unsuccessfully:\n\nUsed furrr to send multiple requests at a time. This did not work because either the LLM or Ollama processed all my requests serially. So there was no improvement.\nI also tried sending more than one row’s text at a time.
