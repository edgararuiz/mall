This function will set to `NA` any response not in the options |\n| x | A vector that contains the text to be analyzed |\n\n\n\n## Value\n `llm_custom` returns a `data.frame` or `tbl` object. `llm_vec_custom` returns a vector that is the same length as `x`. \n\n\n## Examples\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n \nlibrary(mall) \n \nllm_use(\"ollama\", \"llama3.1\", seed = 100, .silent = TRUE) \n \nreviews <- data.frame(review = c( \n  \"This has been the best TV I've ever used.
