If `labels` is a named vector, this function will use those names as the new column names, if not, the function will use a sanitized version of the content as the name. |\n| additional_prompt | Inserts this text into the prompt sent to the LLM |\n| pred_name | A character vector with the name of the new column where the prediction will be placed |\n| x | A vector that contains the text to be analyzed |\n| preview | It returns the R call that would have been used to run the prediction. It only returns the first record in `x`. Defaults to `FALSE` Applies to vector function only. |\n\n\n\n## Value\n `llm_extract` returns a `data.frame` or `tbl` object. `llm_vec_extract` returns a vector that is the same length as `x`. \n\n\n\n\n",
